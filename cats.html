        <p>People who hate cats are walking red flags. Oh, a cat bit you when you were a baby? You were probably provoking it,
            and your negligent parents didn't correct your behavior, so the cat had to. A cat has NEVER bit me without warning.
            I don't care if you were too young to understand the warning; that's not the cat's problem, it's your parents' problem.
            Literally grow up. That cat bit you 20 years ago and you still haven't gotten over it? You're a baby.</p>
