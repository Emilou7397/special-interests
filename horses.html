        <h1>Horses: The Story of a Former Horse Girl&trade;</h1>
        <p>Ok so I used to be a Horse Girl&trade;. There's a difference between Horse Girls&trade; and girls who had horses, by the way.
            Horse Girls&trade; are girls obsessed with horses, but do not own any. If you have horses, it's normal to become kind
            of obsessed, so that's not what we're talking about here.</p>
        <p>My best friend and I conspired to trick my parents into buying one of her horses in elementary school. It obviously
            didn't work, and it was a stupid plan. But I really wanted a horse.</p>
        <p>Anyway, I had a book called
            <a href="https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/the-complete-book-of-horses-debby-sly/1125986074" target="_blank"><i>The Complete Book of Horses</i></a>
            and I was religiously planning which breed(s) I would have and how I would care for them.</p>
        <h2>Favorite Horse Breeds:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <img src="/img/dartmoor-pony.jpeg" alt="">
                <b class="name">Dartmoor</b>Wikipedia says this is a pony, but I remember riding a horse that the owner said was a Dartmoor
                and was definitely a full-sized horse. Maybe I just remember it being bigger because I was smaller?</li>
            <li>
                <img src="/img/friesian.jpeg" alt="">
                <b class="name">Friesian</b>The wavy main and tail are pretty cool.</li>
            <li>
                <img src="/img/lipizzan.jpeg" alt="">
                <b class="name">Lipizzaner</b>I think it was the grey-white color and the cool-sounding name. I have always gravitated towards
                non-brown horses.</li>
            <li>
                <img src="/img/appaloosa.jpeg" alt="">
                <b class="name">Appaloosa</b>Specifically, I wanted a Snowflake Appaloosa.
            </li>
            <li>
                <img src="/img/palomino.jpeg" alt="">
                <b class="name">Palomino</b>This is not a breed, but rather a genetic color. Nonetheless, I wanted a Palomino horse, regardless
                of the breed.</li>
            <li>
                <img src="/img/percheron.jpeg" alt="">
                <b class="name">Percheron</b>At the time, it was not as well-known as the Clydesdale, so I liked it more.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Horse Breeds I Hate:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <img src="/img/arabian.webp" alt="">
                <b class="name">Arabian</b>Why the <b><i>FUCK</i></b> do they look like that?? It's like how humans inbred pugs and French
                bulldogs until they looked as stupid as possible and couldn't breathe. This horse is an affront to God.</li>
            <li>
                <img src="/img/dun.webp" alt="" class="dun">
                <b class="name">Dun</b>This is also not a breed, but rather a gene. The dark stripe down the back just looks so stupid.</li>
            <li>
                <img src="/img/american-quarter-horse.webp" alt="">
                <b class="name">American Quarter Horse</b>Basic.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I stopped being a horse girl when I realized people were making fun of me for it. IDK man, I grew up in a rural small
            town and a lot of people were into the country scene, but because I didn't have the money to have a horse, I was weird
            for liking them. I think we need to be nicer to Horse Girls&trade; because if we're only making fun of the ones that
            don't have the money to have a real horse, that feels kind of classist, no? Maybe I'm just biased.
