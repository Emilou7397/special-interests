        <p>This entry is more about Scott Stapp than <img src="/img/Creed-Band-Logo.png" alt="CREED">, but that's okay.</p>

        <h2>Facts About <img src="/img/Creed-Band-Logo.png" alt="CREED">:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>They are a Christan rock band, and no amount of denial from Scott Stapp is going to change that.
                    Watch the music video for "With Arms Wide Open" and tell me that's not portraying a fucking baptism.
                    He literally spreads his arms out like he's being crucified and then levitates in the "Higher" music video.
                    His continued denial that CREED was a Christan rock band is a slap in the face to anyone with a brain. Get real.</li>
            </ul>
