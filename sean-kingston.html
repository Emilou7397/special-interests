        <h1>Sean Kingston: A Liar and A Fraud</h1>
        <p>So we all know Sean Kingston was arrested in 1999 for his first crime, right?</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>"It was back in '99, watchin' movies all the time<br>Oh, when I went away for doin' my first crime"</p>

        </blockquote>
        <h2 class="red">WRONG</h2>
        <p>Sean Kinston was born on February 3, 1990, and was arrested for breaking and entering at just 11 years old. This means that he went away for doing his first crime no earlier than 2001, <b class="red">NOT 1999.</b></p>
        <p>Therefore, Sean Kingston is a <b class="red">liar and a fraud.</b></p>
